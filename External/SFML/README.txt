This folder is intended to store the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) files required to build and run the KNNProject.

It may include:
- SFML header files (e.g., Graphics, Window, System)
- SFML DLLs or compiled binaries (for local execution only)

Note:
- These files are NOT uploaded to GitHub to avoid large binaries and license issues.
- Please download SFML manually from: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
- Make sure your build system (e.g., CMake or IDE) links to this folder correctly during compilation.
